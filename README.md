# AP Project

## Project Description
🎮 This is a replica of the game **Tank Stars** designed in Java using LibGDX. It features a single-player and a multiplayer game mode, has support for saving and resuming games, and has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the user to learn on the way as they use it.

🚀 It also features close-to-real-life physics that tries to accurately simulate the movement of tanks and trajectory of projectiles through space.
